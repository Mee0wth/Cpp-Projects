Details:
In this program we are using containers to hold characters 
(developed in project 3) in a linked list structure to simulate a 
fantasy combat tournament game. Each round two fighters compete and
the winning fighter gets put back in their teamâ€™s lineup while the loser
gets put into the loser pile. This program will be utilizing concepts we 
learned in Week 7 (Stacks and Queues).
